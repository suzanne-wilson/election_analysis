# Challenge Overview
### Make a copy of the PyPoll.py file that you used throughout this module and rename it PyPoll_Challenge.py.
### Create a list for the counties.
### Create a dictionary where the county is the key and the votes cast for each county in the election are the values.
### Create an empty string that will hold the county name that had the largest turnout.
### Declare a variable that represents the number of votes that a county received. Hint: Inside a for loop, add an if statement to check ### if the county name has already been recorded. If not, add it to the list of county names.
### Inside the with open() function where you are outputting the file, do the following:
### Create three if statements to print out the voter turnout results similar to the results shown above.
### Add the results to the output file.
### Print the results to the command line.
